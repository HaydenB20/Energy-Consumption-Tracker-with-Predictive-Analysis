# Energy Consumption Tracker

## Overview
The Energy Consumption Tracker is a web-based application designed to monitor and analyze energy consumption data. It provides users with insights into their energy usage patterns and predictive analytics to help them make informed decisions about energy consumption.

## Features
- **User Dashboard**: A responsive dashboard that visualizes energy consumption data and predictive insights.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes machine learning models to forecast future energy consumption based on historical data.
- **IoT Integration**: Connects with IoT devices to collect real-time energy consumption data.
- **Data Management**: Robust backend with a well-structured database for storing user and energy consumption data.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React or Angular to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
